GenAI UI Builder
üèÜ Frontend With GenAI Hackathon Submission

This project, "GenAI UI Builder," was developed as a submission for the Frontend With GenAI Hackathon. The objective was to create a frontend solution that leverages AI or automation to solve a real-world problem. Our tool streamlines the UI development process by allowing designers and developers to generate boilerplate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from a simple text description.
‚ú® Features

    Prompt-Based UI Generation: Simply describe the UI you want in a text box and get a complete, single HTML file as a result.

    Accessibility Integration: Each generated UI comes with a list of actionable accessibility suggestions to help you build inclusive and compliant web pages.

    Modern & Responsive Design: The application itself is built with a sleek, modern UI featuring a frosted glass effect and smooth animations.

    Seamless Copy Functionality: Quickly copy the generated code to your clipboard with a single button click.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

    AI/ML Integration: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) for text-to-code generation.

üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

    Clone or Download: Save the index.html, style.css, and script.js files into a single folder on your computer.

    Get an API Key: This project uses the Google Gemini API. You will need to get your own API key from Google AI Studio and paste it into the script.js file.

    // Find this line in script.js
    const apiKey = ""; 

    // And replace it with your key
    const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

    Run the App: Open the index.html file in your web browser.

üí° Future Improvements

Given more time, we would love to implement the following features:

    Code Customization: Allow users to specify a preferred CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) in their prompts.

    Multi-File Output: Generate separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for larger, more complex projects.

    User Account System: Enable users to save, edit, and share their generated UIs.
